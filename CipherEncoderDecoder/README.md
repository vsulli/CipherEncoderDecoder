# CipherEncoderDecoder

This is a program that implements 4 common ciphers to encode and decode text using those ciphers.

[Ciphers Explanations](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/traditional_ciphers.htm)

## Atbash Cipher

Encodes a message by reversing the alphabet. 

## Caesar Cipher / Shift Cipher

Encodes a message by replacing each letter with a different letter x units down.


## Affine Cipher

Encodes a message by mapping a letter to its numerica equivalent, applying a mathematical function, and then converting
it back to a letter.


## Vigenere Cipher

Encodes a message by using a different Caesar cipher on each letter, where a key determines how much it increments.
